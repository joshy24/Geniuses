Many powerful muscles that manipulate the upper arm at the shoulder and the forearm at the elbow are anchored to the humerus. Movement of the humerus is essential to all of the varied activities of the arm, such as throwing, lifting, and writing. The head of the humerus forms the ball of the ball-and-socket shoulder joint, with the glenoid cavity of the scapula acting as the socket. The rounded shape of the head of the humerus allows the humerus to move in a complete circle (circumduction) and rotate around its axis at the shoulder joint. Just below the head, the humerus narrows into the anatomical neck of the humerus. Two small processes, the greater and lesser tubercles, extend from the humerus just below the anatomical neck as attachment points for the muscles of the rotator cuff. The humerus narrows below the tubercles again in a region known as the surgical neck before extending toward elbow joint as the body of the humerus. About a third of the way to the elbow, the humerus swells into a small process known as the deltoid tuberosity, which supports the insertion point of the deltoid muscle. Below the deltoid tuberosity, the humerus gradually widens, doubling its width as it approaches the elbow. The distal end of the humerus contains two joint-forming processes known as the capitulum and trochlea. On the medial side of the arm, the trochlea interlocks with the ulna of the forearm to form half of the elbow joint. On the lateral side of the arm, the convex capitulum forms a loose connection with the concave head of the radius. The shape of the joint between the capitulum and radius allows the forearm and hand to rotate and bend at the elbow while the ulna forms a tight hinge with the trochlea. On the posterior side of the humerus, a small cavity known as the olecranon fossa allows the tip of the ulna, known as the olecranon, to lock into the humerus and prevent the extension of the elbow beyond 180 degrees.

Variation may be shown in physical appearance, metabolism, fertility, mode of reproduction, behaviour, learning and mental ability, and other obvious or measurable characters. Genotypic variations are caused by differences in number or structure of chromosomes or by differences in the genes carried by the chromosomes. Eye colour, body form, and disease resistance are genotypic variations. Individuals with multiple sets of chromosomes are called polyploid; many common plants have two or more times the normal number of chromosomes, and new species may arise by this type of variation. A variation cannot be identified as genotypic by observation of the organism; breeding experiments must be performed under controlled environmental conditions to determine whether or not the alteration is inheritable. Environmentally caused variations may result from one factor or the combined effects of several factors, such as climate, food supply, and actions of other organisms. Phenotypic variations also include stages in an organism’s life cycle and seasonal variations in an individual.

The first option says that ‘atomic size decreases down the group’. This statement is false and here is the reason why. In each group of the periodic table, as we move from top to bottom, successive shells are added to the atomic structures of the elements and the additional space occupied by these added shells helps to counterbalance the effect of the increasing inward pulling force that the nucleus exerts on the electrons. So the overall effect is that the inward pulling force of the nucleus gets weaker as more shells are added (the inward pulling force increases because more protons are added to the nucleus of atoms as the atomic number increases down the group); hence atomic size increases down the group. Let’s take the group 7 elements for example. From top to bottom, the halogens are; Fluorine, chlorine, Bromine, iodine and astatine. A Fluorine atom is the smallest in the halogen group because it has the fewest number of shells (1); while an astatine atom is the largest because it has the largest number of shells (5) So the first option is wrong. The second option is incorrect as well as atomic size decreases across the period because the inward pulling (attractive) force of the nucleus increases as the atomic number increases from left to right; and since the number of shells is the same for all elements in the same period, the overall effect is that the size of the atom gets smaller. The third option says that ‘Anions are smaller than their parent atoms’. An anion is a negatively charged ion, meaning that it has gained electrons and hence is bigger than the parent atom since the added electrons make the outermost shell bigger. Now the last Option says ‘cations are smaller than the parent atom. This is in fact correct because as expected, cations give out or donate electrons and thus have fewer electrons in their outer most shells than the parent atom; resulting in a smaller size than the parent atom.

The hydroxide ions keep on reacting with the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions as long as there are Fe<sup>3+</sup> present. The Hydrogen ions H<sup>+</sup> are not removed from the solution because Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is completely ionized in solution.

It states that: If an external constraint such as a change in temperature, pressure or concentration, is imposed on a chemical system in equilibrium, the equilibrium will shift so as to annul or neutralize the constraint. In essence what Le Chatelier’s Principle is saying is that whenever a chemical system is in equilibrium (by equilibrium we mean that all the parameters of the system remain the same and there is no net change in the system) and ‘something’ from ‘outside’ or the exterior of the system is applied to the system such as change in temperature or pressure, the equilibrium or balance of the system will change or adjust to undo the effect of this external force. Now back to the question; we know that the forward reaction is endothermic since ∆H is positive (+ve). This means that heat is absorbed from the surroundings during the forward reaction (in practical terms, the temperature of the system decreases during an endothermic reaction as heat is removed by the system from the surrounding). Now the question asks what effect a decrease in temperature will have at equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier’s Principle, the equilibrium of the system will adjust to undo the effect of a decrease in temperature; which means that the equilibrium of the system will adjust to favour an increase in temperature, which is the backward reaction, leading to the increased formation of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(g) Hence the concentration of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sub>(g)</sub> increases.
