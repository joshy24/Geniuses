The first option says that ‘atomic size decreases down the group’. This statement is false and here is the reason why. In each group of the periodic table, as we move from top to bottom, successive shells are added to the atomic structures of the elements and the additional space occupied by these added shells helps to counterbalance the effect of the increasing inward pulling force that the nucleus exerts on the electrons. So the overall effect is that the inward pulling force of the nucleus gets weaker as more shells are added (the inward pulling force increases because more protons are added to the nucleus of atoms as the atomic number increases down the group); hence atomic size increases down the group. Let’s take the group 7 elements for example. From top to bottom, the halogens are; Fluorine, chlorine, Bromine, iodine and astatine. A Fluorine atom is the smallest in the halogen group because it has the fewest number of shells (1); while an astatine atom is the largest because it has the largest number of shells (5) So the first option is wrong. The second option is incorrect as well as atomic size decreases across the period because the inward pulling (attractive) force of the nucleus increases as the atomic number increases from left to right; and since the number of shells is the same for all elements in the same period, the overall effect is that the size of the atom gets smaller. The third option says that ‘Anions are smaller than their parent atoms’. An anion is a negatively charged ion, meaning that it has gained electrons and hence is bigger than the parent atom since the added electrons make the outermost shell bigger. Now the last Option says ‘cations are smaller than the parent atom. This is in fact correct because as expected, cations give out or donate electrons and thus have fewer electrons in their outer most shells than the parent atom; resulting in a smaller size than the parent atom.

The hydroxide ions keep on reacting with the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions as long as there are Fe<sup>3+</sup> present. The Hydrogen ions H<sup>+</sup> are not removed from the solution because Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is completely ionized in solution.

It states that: If an external constraint such as a change in temperature, pressure or concentration, is imposed on a chemical system in equilibrium, the equilibrium will shift so as to annul or neutralize the constraint. In essence what Le Chatelier’s Principle is saying is that whenever a chemical system is in equilibrium (by equilibrium we mean that all the parameters of the system remain the same and there is no net change in the system) and ‘something’ from ‘outside’ or the exterior of the system is applied to the system such as change in temperature or pressure, the equilibrium or balance of the system will change or adjust to undo the effect of this external force. Now back to the question; we know that the forward reaction is endothermic since ∆H is positive (+ve). This means that heat is absorbed from the surroundings during the forward reaction (in practical terms, the temperature of the system decreases during an endothermic reaction as heat is removed by the system from the surrounding). Now the question asks what effect a decrease in temperature will have at equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier’s Principle, the equilibrium of the system will adjust to undo the effect of a decrease in temperature; which means that the equilibrium of the system will adjust to favour an increase in temperature, which is the backward reaction, leading to the increased formation of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(g) Hence the concentration of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sub>(g)</sub> increases.
